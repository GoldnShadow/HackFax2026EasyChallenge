Valentine's day is on the 14th every year.
And every year, it was never that good.
Loving you, made every day better.
Every moment we share feels like a dream. 
No matter where we go, I am home with you. 
Together, we've built a world all our own.
I promise to hold your hand through everything.
Now I finally understand what true joy is. 
Everlasting is the love I give to you.
